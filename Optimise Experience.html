					<h4>This report will demonstrate my work on improving nbn’s optimise experience. This includes using the double diamond methodology. From the discovery phase, define, develop and deliver to the final solution.</h4>

						<p>Improving your internet Experience is my solution to the issues made clear by primary and secondary research. Optimisation needed an overhaul to solve key user issues and get them the relevant information to get their internet fixed/improved in a timely manner. </p>
						
						<p>My proposed solution is a one page user journey for learning and troubleshooting their internet, to achieve a better experience. This journey will help users go through step by step process of elimination and give them guidance opportunities to improve their internet. THis journey will help users solve their internet needs, relieving frustration, and improving their internet needs.</p>

						<h2>My Role</h2>

					<h3><li>User research</li>
						<li>Interaction</li>
						<li>Visual design</li>
						<li>Prototyping</li>
						<li>User Testing and facilitating</li></h3>


					<h2>The Objective</h2>

					<p>Design the core strategic component of the connected customer refresh, Optimise to be a helpful and engaging experience. This includes the Optimise landing page itself, and its child pages ( Steps to boost your Wi-Fi, Choosing the right speed, Tips for your home and Office). The objective in particular, is to reduce cognitive load of pages, allow users to flow between pages easily and solve their needs. feel empowered to fix/optimize their internet with no fuss and leave the page satisfied.</p>


					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>nbn build is now complete, there is a focus on maintaining users and providing support on their internet. This project is refreshing the public website to better cater towards Connected Customer refresh key four scenarios (Connect, optimise, upgrade & support ), and to implement end-to-end Digital Customer Journeys that specifically target nbn’s CX and revenue objectives with a focus on high-speed tiers. Focusing on the end users trust, relatability, time and control 
					</p>

					<h2>Discover</h2>
					<p>Past research on optimize demonstrated that: Optimise and its child pages tested positively with the populace based on previous research studies on the nbn website. Users liked the layout of the pages themselves, in particular the chunking of content. The first round of user testing only showed minor issues with the pages however with further discovery I discovered ways to improve optimise
					</p>

					<h2>Heuristic Evaluation 
					</h2>

					<p>To start off this process I examined the current optimise experience myself to immerse my self in the experience. I gave myself three tasks to complete. This allowed me to examine the possibilities to enhance product usability from early in development.</p>

					<h3>Three tasks 
					</h3>

				<p>- I want to boost my wifi,
					- I want to discover what speed would suit me.
					- Further I want to discover tips for home and office setups 
					</p>


					<h3>Findings</h3>


					<p><b>
							<li>There needs to be a reduction in the way information is presented. It feels like information overload, a perfect example is the current “Steps to boost your wifi page.” On the page there are 5 components that users will have to scroll through.  </li>
						<li>
							The current user flow is disjointed and requires breadcrumbs of some kind, to allow the user to go through the full experience if required.</li>
						<li>It requires more clear visuals for users as the “wifi in the home” can take some time to understand.
							</li>
						<li>It is difficult to start to experience/find all the pages of “Optimise.”
							</li>
						</b>
					</p>

					<h2>Interviews</h2>

					<P>Next I conducted Interviews with 8 participants from different demographics in Australia. These interviewees were given abstract/concrete tasks based on using optimise. These included tasks such as:</P>

					<p><b>
						<li>1. You want to find out information about wi-fi speeds and discover what speed would suit you best. How do you go about this?   </li>
					<li>
						2.You think your wi-fi modem is slow and you want to know if there is a way to boost your wi-fi strength.</li>
					</b>
				</p>	

				<h3>Key User Quotes</h3>

				<blockquote><b>
					<li>“Optimisation is hard to find. I have no idea where to start. It is not clear if it is in learn, residential or the home page.”  </li>
				<li>
					“So much reading. Having to read so much content to get to the facts, when you just want to skim. ” </li>

					<li>“It is a lot easier for me if I google search ‘nbn optimise’, instead of navigating to it on the nbn website.”</li>

					<li>“The optimize experience feels too separated.” 
					</li>
				</b>
				</blockquote>	

<h2>Affinity Diagram Synthesis</h2>

					<figure><img src="assets/images/Optimise/Affinity_Diagram.jpg" alt="Image of affinity diagram"><figcaption>Synthesising Results</figcaption></figure>

					<h3>Top Insights</h3>
					

					<p><b>
						<li>Insight: Many users found that there is no connected flow between optimise and its child pages. </li>
					<li>
						Insight: For many users there is too much information for them to want to go through </li>
	
						<li>Insight: All 8 participants struggled to find the optimise experience.</li>

						<li>Insight: Many users do not see nbn as a support and would inquire to their retail service provider before looking at nbn for answers.</li>

						<li>Insight: Majority of users want to have easy to understand visuals with chunked content.
						</li>
	
					</b>
				</p>


				<h3>Criteria for Success</h3>>

<p>From gathering the insights I came up with a criteria for success in order to improve optimise for the better. </p>


<blockquote><b>

<li>There needs to be simple to understand visuals and information </li>

	<li>The solution needs to be explained well and solve key user scenarios </li>
	
	<li>There has to be a connected flow  </li>
	
	<li>The experience should be easy to start and find</li>
	
	<li>To retain information there needs to be interaction and/or personalisation </li>
	

</b></blockquote>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<h4>Many users do not come to the nbn website for support, if they do they struggle to 
	find optimisation and it’s child pages. They face inconsistent layouts, poor flows, difficulty to 
	find, hard to understand diagrams, tedious clickables and they have to sift through information to find their answer which gives them frustration. We need to overhaul this experience to solve key user issues and get them the relevant information to get their internet fixed/improved in a timely manner.
	</h4>

	<p>
	</p>
	<h1>Ideation</h1>

	<h2>Crazy 8's</h2>

	<p>After receiving valuable insights I started to brainstorm ideas utilising to crazy 8 method. This is conducted by creating rough sketches of ideas in under a minute each. </p>


						<figure><img src="assets/images/Optimise/Crazy8_1.jpg" alt="Crazy 8 figure 1"><figcaption>Crazy 8 figure 1</figcaption></figure>
						<p></p>
						<figure><img src="assets/images/Optimise/Crazy8_2.jpg" alt="Crazy 8 figure 2"><figcaption>Crazy 8 figure 2</figcaption></figure>
<p></p>
<p>These included ideas on chat bots, 3D modem placement mini game, metaphors for explaining wi-fi modem setups, one page journeys, quizlets, a tool kit to troubleshoot internet, geolocation based information, 15 second shorts on explaining information and a tool to find what plan suits a household best. </p>
<p></p>
					<h2>DFV Criteria
						</h2>

						<p>A Desirability, Variability and Feasibility Criteria. Due to the nature of work, I had to be grounded with the ideation, and examine reasonable solutions that will be wanted, not too difficult to implement and be on a lower maintenance level. This led to a significant amount of ideas being culled and absorbed into larger/smaller ideas. 
</p>
<p>I nicknamed my solutions and scaled them from 1-10 based on each criteria in the DFV. 
							</p>
							<figure><img src="assets/images/Optimise/DFV Criteria.png" alt="DFV criteria table"><figcaption>DFV criteria table</figcaption></figure>


							<h3>Potential Solutions after a DFV Criteria 
							</h3>

							<p><b><li>1.Improving your internet starts here</li>

								<li>2.Tailor made</li>
								
								<li>3.Short snippets</li>
								</b></p>

<h3>Potential Solutions 1: Tailor Made</h3>

<figure><img src="assets/images/Optimise/Tailor_Made.jpg" alt="Tailor Made Ideation"><figcaption>Ideation: Tailor Made</figcaption></figure>

<P> This solution would allow the user to be able to check their address and receive information based on the connection they have (adjusting information to their needs/geolocation). This will give the user personalised tools and information for troubleshooting and improving their internet.</P>

<h3>Potential Solutions – Short Snippets
</h3>

<figure><img src="assets/images/Optimise/Short_Snippets.jpg" alt="Short Snippets Ideation"><figcaption>Ideation: Short Snippets</figcaption></figure>

						<p>This solution aims to give users quick bite size chunks of information.. This can consist of short videos or animated gifs that explain a concept to the user. This can save the user time having to sift through pages themselves to find the relevant information. 
						</p>

						<p>
							An example of this is a wifi modem overheating, when the user connects more devices, the modem will struggle with the increased load, demonstrating the worse the user's internet is going to perform. The user can avoid this by upgrading their modem to a more advanced modem such as a wi-fi mesh system. 
						</p>

						<h3>Improve your Internet Starts Here
						</h3>

						<p>This solution rated strongest against the DFV criteria, due to the ease of implementation by reusing existing components in our design system. Further it was low maintenance and gave a clear overview of what users can perform in order to improve their internet. 
						</p>

						<P>
							‘Improve your Internet Starts Here’ Is a one page singular journey that starts with a key user scenario and caters information to that key scenario. The journey would be located as a clear tile on the homepage as users struggled to find Optimise and its child pages. The key scenarios include common google searched questions such as  “I want my video to stop buffering” and “my internet is slow what do I do?”, Once the user chose their scenario they would receive a high level overview using a stepper and progress bar on ways to improve their internet. Some solutions included moving the modem closer, changing speed plans, upgrading the modem and much more. At the end of the experience, the user would receive a review/summary on actions they need to take.
							</P>

<h1>Prototyping</h1>

<h2>Paper Prototype</h2>

<p>I sketched up the journey using pen and paper for an immediate cost-effective testing method to assess the ease and usefulness of the design idea </p>
<p>The paper prototype features several new experiences, the first is a ‘place your modem’ mini game, this teaches users on the ideal placement of technology in the house and further educates them on wifi meshes and extenders. The second is a speed test calculator, the user can input how many users there are in the household, how many devices they have, how often they use all at the same time, the type of activities they conduct using the internet and finally the type of connection they have. This calculator would inform the user on the type of plan that would suit their needs and give links to retail service provider options. </p>

<figure><img src="assets/images/Optimise/Paper_Prototype_Flow_Opt.jpg" alt="Paper Prototype"><figcaption>Paper Prototype I created and tested</figcaption></figure>

<h3>User Testing</h3>

<p>6 Participants from the initial discovery interviews</p>

<h3>Insights</h3>

<blockquote>
	<li><b>One page journey flow works well and is straight to the point.</b> “I like how it flows, you always have next steps if you can not solve a problem. I can keep going until I find the answer.”
		 “If the speed is bad then I know its the modem so I want to see if there are upgrade options available.”
		</li>
<li><b>The prototype requires a review as the order currently is confusing. There needs to be more of a process of elimination rather than a combination of the optimise pages.</b>
	</li>
<li><b>The 'What you have learnt' section requires a change as not everyone might have learnt something.</b>

	</li>
<li><b>The place your modem mini game is useful and engaging however it should be optional.</b> "I like the mini game, I think the digitally illiterate likes the confirmation on their learning. It is a good way to confirm, as it explains, then says let try this together, then try on your own."
	</li>

	<li><b>Users praised the speed test calculator.</b>
		“I love how it reverses the order in finding the right plan.”
		
	</li>
</blockquote>



<h3>New User Flow</h3>
<figure><img src="assets/images/Optimise/User_Flow.jpg" alt="New User FLow"><figcaption>New User Flow from feedback</figcaption></figure>

<blockquote>Two user groups:
	<li>Users who would like to learn about Optimisation</li>
	<li>Users who would like to troubleshoot their internet</li>
	</blockquote>

<p>
	A new user flow was created to reflect the reordering of content from the paper prototype testing. The new flow showcases the extent of what the Optimise experience can achieve. This flow however does not solve for network drop outs, retail service provider issues, nbn cable installation issues. The user would be informed on the extent of what they can and cannot achieve in this experience. 
	</p>

<h3> The Screens
</h3>
<h1>WORK IN PROGRESS</h1>

<!-- <h2>HIGH-FIDELITY INSIGHTS
</h2>

<p><b>Our final round of user testing provided the following insights which informed the final iterations:</b></p>
<blockquote>
      <p><strong>Iconography, labelling and language:</strong> This round of user testing stressed the importance of using icons for each labelled  element, which is especially important for the app to be intuitive to use for young children. For example, our youngest participant who was 6 years old knew what the word ‘customise’ meant, but couldn’t recognise the written word on the screen. An iteration we made based off this feedback was including the paintbrush icon next to the customise bar on the ‘My Tree’ page. We found that no children had trouble logging in or out, and we can attribute this to adequate labelling and use of icons, as well as from children's prior experience using devices. Some younger children didn’t know the word ‘flora’ within the shop, and this was changed in the final version.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
      <p><strong>Navigation:</strong> The top navigation bar was very well received, and was the primary navigation tool for most participants. All 6 users initially didn’t realise that they could swipe between screens as a secondary navigation tool, despite the arrows on either side of the screen, yet all of them agreed that they would like to use it once they knew it was there. Interestingly, one participant was initially only using the top navigation bar, and <strong> organically discovered </strong>she could swipe between screens by accident. From that point onwards, she used a combination of swiping and the navigation bar to get to different pages. In the follow up questions , this participant said that she would use a combination of swiping and tapping to navigate, and couldn’t articulate why she didn’t see the swiping arrows initially. She also thought that it would be easy to ‘accidentally’ swipe between screens, and for that reason they wouldn’t need to be made more obvious.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
      <p><strong>Profile:</strong> There are several types of incentives to complete challenges within Finance Forest, these are monetary (earning coins) and non monetary (unlocking items in the shop and the ranking system). Another non-monetary incentive was the progress rings within each child’s profile, which is also visible for friends within the Class Forest. Four participants  could identify that the progress rings were a visualisation of the completion of different tasks, yet most agreed they wouldn’t care about knowing their progress in terms of numbers and percentages. For this reason, we decided to change the profile to display an alternative incentive. In the final version of Finance Forest, this has changed to badges, which display goals the user must reach to earn a badge.</p>
</blockquote>
      <p>Ultimately, our final round of user testing proved to be very insightful, and allowed us to make minor changes to Finance Forest which made a big difference to it’s ease of use. We paid close attention to the dexterity of children, and made sure elements weren’t too close together.<strong> Children received the app well, and  all children said they would like to use it in a classroom environment.</strong> </p>

	<p>
		
	</p>
	<h1>THE SOLUTION
	</h1>

	<h2>OUR DESIGN
	</h2>

<p>The final design is an interactive learning companion that utilises gamification to help children understand financial concepts by <b>bridging the gap between perceptions of physical and digital money.</b> Our design process has been user centric from the beginning, and this is demonstrated through our final application which has undergone several iterations. Children can move freely between pages, and learn at their own pace, with (play) monetary and non-monetary incentives to encourage them.
</p>

<p>Additionally, the social element of Finance Forest keeps the application <b>interesting and dynamic</b>, and encourages healthy competition between peers. Smaller details such as the price breakdown when making a purchase subtly makes monetary value more familiar to children. Ultimately, Finance Forest has the potential to make a significant difference in the lives of children growing up in the digital age by encouraging a positive long lasting relationship with money.

			<figure><img src="assets/images/Finance Forest/Next.png" alt="PP"><figcaption></figcaption>NEXT STEPS</figcaption></figure>


        </figure>

        <p>We aim to <strong> add more features </strong> and customisation to make the application even more engaging. This will include timed in-game events, a tree maintenance mini game to earn extra money, and the possibility for users to unlock accessories to customise their avatars.</p>

        <p>When it becomes time for implementation, partnering with the federal government would be ideal and most likely necessary to be rolled out across schools.</p>

        <p>After establishing ourselves within the primary school system, we could then develop a version for high school students, making sure the content is stimulating and information is given in bite-sized chunks. We would likely expand the application to mobiles as highschools are often more crowded and less inclined to use iPads.</p>

        <p>Eventually if our successes continue, we want to spread Finance Forest globally, venturing into schools all around the world. This would be a large undertaking as other countries have varied expectations of education, and we would have to be considerate of cultural differences. Ideally we will be able to assist children, teenagers and young adults in forming excellent monetary habits all across the world.</p>

        <p>Once we begin to commercialise, we will have to consider the stakeholders affected by Finance Forest. An impact of having a program dedicated to financial literacy means that the schools limited curriculum will have to change to accomodate it. Teachers and students will have to adapt to the new program, potentially losing time from other subjects.</p>

        <p>The potential positives of teaching children financial literacy will far outweigh the negatives. Being in control of your finances can be life changing.A high level of financial literacy can even boost the economy, in Australia, and globally. As users make better decisions and avoid the burden of debt, an economy with more jobs and opportunities is inevitable (Damayanti et. al.  2018).</p>
